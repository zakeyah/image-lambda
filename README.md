### how to use your lambda.

- create a function in lambda AWS
- add a zip file to the function
- creat S3 bucket 
- added a trigger to the bucket that will trigger lambda function.

### issues 
- at first i uplode the zip file with index.js && package.json  only
so it give me error
then solve it by zip the node_modules with index.js && package.json
